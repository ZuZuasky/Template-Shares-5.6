Someone, hopefully you, requested that the password for the account associated with this email address ({1}) be reset.

The request originated from {2}.

If you did not do this ignore this email. Please do not reply.

Should you wish to confirm this request, please follow this link:

{3}/recover.php?id={4}&secret={5}

(AOL Email users may need to copy and paste the link into your web browser).

After you do this, your password will be reset and emailed back to you.

If you could not validate your password by clicking on the link, please
visit this page:

{3}/recover.php?act=manual

below:

User ID: {4}

Secret Key: {5}

Please copy and paste, or type those numbers into the corresponding fields in the form.

If you still cannot validate your account, it\'s possible that the account has been removed.
If this is the case, please contact an administrator to rectify the problem.

Thank you for registering and enjoy your stay!
