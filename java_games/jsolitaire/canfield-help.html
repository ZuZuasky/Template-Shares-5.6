<H1> Canfield Solitaire Instructions </H1>

<H2> Overview </H2>
Like Klondike solitaire, the goal of Canfield is to move all the cards in a
deck to suit stacks of ascending rank, forming stacks of descending rank an
alternate color as an intermediate stage. Cards are drawn from a deck three
at a time. Unlike Klondike, the base card of the suit stacks is usually not
an ace. In addition to the deck, 13 cards are placed in a reserve of which
only the top is accessible.

<H2> Layout </H2>

There are four parts of the screen.

<UL>
<LI> <B>Reserve</B>
The reserve consists of 13 cards on the left side of the top row. The top
card of the reserve is turned face up and can be moved to the building
stacks or the suit stacks.

<P><LI> <B>Suit Stacks</B>
The suit stacks are located on the right side of the upper row. The starting
rank of the suit stacks is determined by a randomly drawn card which is
moved to the suit stacks. A "ghost" card indicates the base card of the
other three stacks.

<P><LI> <B>Deck</B>
The deck is located on the left side of the bottom row. Three cards from the
deck are turned up from the deck and placed to the right of the deck. The
topmost of these three can be moved to a suit or building stack. Clicking on
the deck or rightclicking anywhere on the screen will turn over an
additional three cards. When there are no more cards in the deck, an outline
will appear. Clicking inside the outline will begin another pass through the
deck. An unlimited number of passes through the deck can be made.

<P><LI> <B>Building Stacks</B>
The building stacks are found in the right side of the bottom row. Each
stack initially contains one randomly chosen card. A card can be placed on
top of the stack if it has a different color and a rank one less than the
card currently at the top. Stacks can be merged, leaving an empty space, but
moving part of one stack to another is not allowed. Empty building stacks
can only accept cards from the reserve (which will be moved automatically).
Cards can be moved from the deck to an empty space if the reserve is
exhausted.
</UL>

<H2> Moving Cards </H2>

To move a card, click on the card (which will highlight it) and then
click on the destination. The following are valid moves:

<OL>

<LI>
A card can be moved from the reserve, deck or top of the building stacks to
the suit stacks if the card's suit is the same as the cards in the stack and
the card's rank is the base rank of the building stack or one more than the
card at the top of the stack. (Aces are placed on top of kings in the suit
stacks.)

<P><LI> A card from the reserve or deck can be moved to the top of a building
stock if the card has a different color and a rank one less than the card
at the top of the stack. (Kings can be placed on aces.)
<P><LI> A card from the reserve can fill to an empty building stack.
 If the reserve is empty, a card from the deck can fill an empty building
stack.
<P><LI> An entire building stack can be moved to the top of another building
stack.
</OL> <P>

A card will be automatically moved to the suit stacks from the building
stacks if the cards which might be placed on top of it are already in the
suit stacks. Clicking undo will retract an automatic move.

<H2> Buttons </H2>

Clicking on these buttons will perform the following actions:

<DL>
<DT><B> New Game</B> <DD>Begin a new game after shuffling the deck
<DT><B> Restart</B> <DD> Return to the original state of the current game
<DT><B> Undo</B> <DD> Return to the condition before the previous move was
made
<DT><A NAME="options"><B> Options</B> </A> <DD> Bring up a window with the
following options:
<DL> <DT> <B> Number of cards drawn </B>
<DD> This option determines the number of cards which are turned up
from the deck at a time. The number can vary from 1 to 5, with 3 the default.
<DT> <B>Number of redeals</B> <DD>This sets the additional number of passes
which can be made through the deck
<DT> <B>Display deck contents</B> <DD>
Setting this option will display a listing of the deck, highlighting the
available card. After the initial pass through the deck, upcoming cards will
be displayed above the current card, with the accessible cards appearing in
the rightmost column. Occasionally it is beneficial to refrain from removing
a card from the deck because it will a set up a better order in the
subsequent pass through the deck. Listing the deck will show when these
instances occur.
<DT>  <B> Automatic card moving </B> <DD>
When this box is set (which is the default), a card atop a building stack
will be moved to its suit stack automatically if there are no
cards available which might be placed on top of it. </DL>
